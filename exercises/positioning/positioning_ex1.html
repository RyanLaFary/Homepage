  <h1>Experimenting with Relative and Absolute Positioning</h1>
</header>

<section class="intro">
  <p>The position property identifies how an element is positioned on a page and whether or not it will appear within the regular flow of the page's elements. Absolute and Relative positioning works with the box offset properties - <code>top, right, bottom, left</code> - which identify where the element will be either positioned or moved from.</p>

  <p>By default every element is <code>position: static</code> which means that it exists in the normal flow of the page and does accept any of the box offset properties.</p>
