<p>Vent Haven Museum ("vent" is lingo for "ventriloquist") just off the Interstate 75 Fort Mitchell exit in Northern Kentucky, is the world's only museum of ventriloquial figures and memorabilia. If it's ventriloquism-related, you'll find it at Vent Haven If you're a ventriliquist this may be the cultural center of your world!</p>

<p>The museum houses figures from many ventriloquists, but it began with a collection by William Shakespeare Berger. Berger, who was president of Cambridge Tile Co. in Cincinnati, began collecting ventriloquial figures after purchasing his first on a trip to New York.</p>

<p>Eventually, Berger's collection numbered 500 dummies and puppets. Today, the museum houses 800. A corner devoted to Berger's favorites includes his first purchase, Tommy Baloney, and Skinny Hamilton, Champagne Charlie, Jocko the Monkey and the Hamlet skull, which Berger used in presentations at Beechwood High School.</p>
